<!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
<div id="article-body">
<p>
  Closures are one of those topics that will probably pop up in your JavaScript interviews. Newer developers are usually scared of them (I know I was), but there's no reason to be. Like <a href="/pages/articles/recursion_no_fibonacci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recursion</a>, closures can be over-explained in a way that makes them sound complex, yet at their core they couldn't be simpler. I'll prove it by writing one in 7 lines.
</p>

<h2>A simple closure</h2>
<my-code><!--
function setupClosure() {
  const x = 2;
  return function runClosure(y) {
    console.log(x * y);
  }
}

setupClosure()(4);
--><pre>8</pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  Boom. That's all there is, since:
</p>

<blockquote>
  A closure is when a function uses variables from a higher scope.
</blockquote>

<p>
  If you want to be super specific: "A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state" <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">-mdn</a>. But what I said means the same thing. Also "A function forming a closure" and "a closure" are used interchangeably in common speech, so I'm just going to call the function a closure to save time.
</p>

<p>
  That inner function, <code>runClosure</code> is the closure in this case, because it accesses variables from the outer scope <i>without</i> exposing them. That “exposed” part is a big reason why we even use closures. By only exposing the function, and not the variables it references, we essentially make them private. But before we talk about what closures are for, let's make sure we understand what we wrote.
</p>

<details>
  <summary>
    Why aren't those arrow functions?
  </summary>
  <p>
    Of course closures work with both arrow and declared functions, however arrows are anonymous. In this article, where we'll be printing out function definitions, declared functions and their names are a little more illustrative. However, it would be a good challenge for you to convert all the named functions to arrows in your own notes!
  </p>
</details>

<h2>Breaking it down</h2>
<p>
  Of these two functions let's look at <code>setupClosure</code> first. In this function's scope, three things happen:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>we define a variable x to be 2</li>
  <li>we define a function called <code>runClosure</code></li>
  <li><i>We return the <code>runClosure</code> <b>definition</b></i></li>
</ol>

<p>
   Returning it is the “weird” part since we don't normally return function definitions, we just call them. If we call <code>setupClosure</code>, you can see that the value we get is the <code>runClosure</code>'s definitions:
</p>

<my-code><!--
setupClosure();
--><pre>ƒ runClosure(y) {
  console.log(x * y)
}</pre>
</my-code>

<div class="call-out">
  <p>
    By the way, you can use any console you like, but I recommend using Chrome's console to work with the examples since it has by far the nicest printing.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Anyway, you may have seen something like this before from a typo. A function's definition is the return value when we forget to actually invoke it with <code>()</code>:
</p>

<my-code><!--
function example() {
  return "My example value";
}

// whoops!
example;
--><pre>ƒ example() {
  return "My example value"
}
</pre>
</my-code>

<h2>Calling the closure</h2>
<p>
  So if the only difference between returning a function's calculated value or its definition is the (), what happens if we add another <code>()</code>?
</p>

<my-code><!--
setupClosure()(4);
--><pre>8</pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  As you saw before, we call the <code>runClosure</code> function. Here's some pseudo code to illustrate the relationship:
</p>

<my-code><!--
// if this means:
setupClosure() ====> function runClosure(y) {
                       return x * y
                     }

// then this means:
setupClosure()(5) => runClosure(5)
--><pre></pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  That double <code>()</code> looks weird though, so normally people assign the setup function to a new name like this:
</p>

<my-code><!--
const doubleNum = setupClosure();
doubleNum(5);
--><pre>10</pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  That reads a little cleaner, and it also lets us have another chance to describe the closure function with another variable name. This is a nice way to get a nice <a href="/pages/articles/readable_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> code readability boost</a>.
</p>

<h2>What about x?</h2>
<p>
  One of the best parts of closures are those inner variables, those <i>enclosed</i> values, because we have values that no other part of our program can touch. This is the power of closures: it lets us use data that can't be altered or accessed by any functions <i>other</i> than the closure itself.
</p>

<p>
  The reason this works is because scopes can access values in their parents, but not their children. <code>x</code> is defined in the same scope as <code>runClosure</code>. That means the body of <code>runClosure</code> is a child scope, so it can see <code>x</code> and multiply it by <code>y</code>. However, the only thing that gets exposed to the <code>global</code> scope is the <code>runClosure</code> function definition. Therefore, the only way we can interact with <code>x</code> is by using <code>runClosure</code>.
</p>

<h3>Avoiding accidents</h3>
<p>
  Look at this counting function that uses a closure to grab a value in a higher scope, <i>except</i> the counter isn't protected:
</p>

<my-code><!--
let count = 1;
function counter() {
  return count++;
}

counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3

count += 38;
counter(); // 42
/* shit */
-->
</my-code>

<p>
  No good right? Now let's use a setup function to protect our closured variable:
</p>

<my-code><!--
function setupCounter(count = 1) {
  return () => count++;
}

const counter = setupCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3
count += 34; // ERROR: count is not defined
counter(); // 4
/* nice */
--><pre></pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  What's important to notice here is that 1) our value is no longer <code>global</code>, so it's protected, and 2) the parameters of one function still count as a higher scope to a child function.
</p>

<p>
  As you can see the basics of closures are simple: they rely on function bodies being able to reach up the scope chain, but not down. These sorts of closures that are only for privatizing a variable aren't super common though. What's a little more common is hitting closures when defining helper functions. So let's look at an example of that before we go.
</p>

<h2>Real world examples</h2>
<p>
  Here we have a piece of code from a multiplication table app. You can click on buttons to see the multiplication results of a multiplier. The multiplier is saved on each button, and then when a user clicks on that, we display all the different values on a table row.
</p>

<my-code><!--
button.addEventListener((e) => {
  const { multiplier } = e.target.dataset;

  const cells = document.querySelectorAll('.result');
  cells.forEach((cellNode, idx) => {
    cellNode.textContent = multiplier * (idx + 1);
  });
});
-->
</my-code>

<p>
  This code is already using a closure! Did you spot it? That's right, it's the <code>forEach</code> callback with <code>multiplier</code>. Remember, if a function ever references a variable that <i>wasn't</i> passed in, that function is forming a closure.
</p>
<p>
  Let's refactor this code. We only reference <code>cells</code> once, what if we call <code>forEach</code> directly on the query result? And to keep our line length down, let's define an <code>updateTableRow</code> function and pass that to <code>forEach</code>:
</p>

<my-code><!--
const updateTableRow = (cellNode, idx)=> {
  cellNode.textContent = multiplier * (idx + 1);
}

button.addEventListener((e) => {
  const { multiplier } = e.target.dataset;

  document.querySelectorAll('.result')
    .forEach(updateTableRow);
});
--><pre>ERR: multiplier is not defined</pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  That no longer works because we broke our closure. <code>updateTableRow</code> isn't defined in the same scope as <code>multiplier</code> anymore. Sometimes, there are so many closured variables in a function, that the easiest thing to do is just define it in the same scope on a new line:
</p>

<my-code><!--
button.addEventListener((e) => {
  const updateTableRow = (cellNode, idx)=> {
    cellNode.textContent = multiplier * (idx + 1);
  };
  const { multiplier } = e.target.dataset;

  document.querySelectorAll('.result')
    .forEach(updateTableRow);
});
-->
</my-code>

<p>
  That's better than an inline function, but we can't reuse <code>updateTableRow</code> in any other function. We can do better than that here. Remember our parameter trick from before? Well, we can use that here:
</p>

<my-code><!--
const updateTableRow = (num) => (cellNode, idx)=> {
  cellNode.textContent = num * (idx + 1);
};

button.addEventListener((e) => {
  const { multiplier } = e.target.dataset;

  document.querySelectorAll('.result')
    .forEach(updateTableRow(multiplier));
});
--><pre></pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  Here we pass in the <code>multiplier</code> to <code>updateTableRow</code>. Then, the actual callback for <code>forEach</code> is the <i>function definition</i> that gets returned, which of course has access to <code>multiplier</code> through <code>num</code>! This is a super handy technique because we can share <code>updateTableRow</code> to <i>any</i> other <code>forEach</code> we like. We're simply taking the closured value and moving it from one parent function to another.
</p>

<h3>Beware of side effects</h3>
<p>
  You've heard of "pure" functions, where the same inputs will always yield the same output, right? Well, closures break that, so be careful. By its very definition, closure means that the input arguments of the function aren't the only pieces of data it's pulling in. Whenever you use closures, make sure the data that winds up affecting the function is <i>exactly</i> what you think it is.
</p>

<h2>Another tool in your belt</h2>
<p>
  Closures can come in handy in your code, they are an excellent concept to internalize in case they come up in an interview. Play around with them a bit in your next project, and look out for where you may have unknowingly already defined them (probably in your array functions).
</p>

<p>Happy coding everyone,</p>
