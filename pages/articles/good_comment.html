<!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
<div id="article-body">
<p>
  Is it bad to comment your code? People have strong opinions either way and it can get...<em>intense</em>. It's not exactly tabs-vs-spaces but it's close. Some engineers think that "truly" self documenting code doesn't ever need them. While I do love <a href="/pages/articles/readable_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">readable code</a>, I think comments can be invaluable if used properly. So let's jump into the flame war and talk about what makes a good comment.
</p>
<h2>What vs. why</h2>
<p>A common critique of comments is that they're redundant:</p>
<my-code><!--
// add students to honor roll if they have a high grade
students.forEach(student => {
  if (student.grade > honorRoll) {
    honorRollStudents.push(student)
  }
}
--><pre></pre>
</my-code>

<p>Once you get better at reading code, these kinds of comments become useless. I think bad comments point out the <em>what</em>, while good comments explain  the <em>why</em>. Here's the rule of thumb I like: </p>

<blockquote style="max-width: 23rem; margin: auto">
  A comment should be added to answer a question that the code can't.
</blockquote>

<p>
  If you aren't confused by what a piece of code is doing, but rather why it's doing it <em>at that moment</em>, then a comment could help.
</p>

<h2>A frustratingly real world example</h2>
<p>
  Take a hypothetical situation where we're debugging user migration code:
</p>

<my-code><!--
if (user.default_name) delete user.default_name;
await User.migrate(user);
--><pre></pre>
</my-code>

<p>
  Why are we deleting <code>default_name</code>? Our first instinct is to search the repo for other instances of <code>default_name</code>, but we just find a typing that says it's a string. We ask our team, but no one knows, and the guy who wrote it quit. Is it just because we're using the newer <code>username</code> field now? We're forced go to Slack and ask if anyone uses it. Turns out, the subscriptions team has a legacy system that uses <code>default_name</code>'s existence to determine if a user is from <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>. Since we're migrating to <code>v2</code>, we delete the field.
</p>

<h2>Adding an explanation</h2>
<p>
  Now that we know why we're doing it, we could put it into a function with a descriptive name like <code>makeSureUserAppearsNewToSubscriptionAPI</code>. Some people would do this, but it doesn't always make sense to add an entire function. Instead, a comment could solve the problem.
</p>

<my-code><!--
// subscription API needs this field gone for v2 users
if (user.default_name) delete user.default_name;
-->
</my-code>

<p>
  It instantly explains the situation without anyone else's help. And if a future dev has questions, they'll know what team to talk to. And if it changes, we don't need to edit any other functions, just this one comment.
</p>

<h2>“That's bad code”</h2>
<p>
  I can already <em>feel</em> the skeptics saying that the comment wouldn't be needed if the system was designed better, if there was better knowledge sharing, or if there were real docs. And you know what? They are absolutely right.
</p>

<p>
  ...if we lived in a coding textbook. In real life, code gets pushed out quickly, legacy software does weird stuff, tickets are too vague, and internal docs are <em>always</em> a low priority. To me, comments are a clunky solution, but a clunky solution is better than no solution. However, that doesn't mean we should overdo comments.
</p>

<h2>Less is more</h2>
<p>
  Just because I like comments doesn't mean I like a lot of them. If you find yourself writing things that sound more like helpful tips that succinct explanations, you should move them into your team's docs, or at the very least to your personal notes.
</p>

<h3>Keep them short</h3>
<p>
  Comments will always be controversial, so the shorter the better:
</p>

<my-code><!--
// we need this to set up the user's permissions for v3 auth method
should be
// set user permissions for updated v3 auth
-->
</my-code>

<h3>Longer comments should be formatted</h3>
<p>
  If you need more than one line, try breaking out the confusing piece of code into a function, and then add a <a href="https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/about-getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jsDoc</a> style comment. This is super handy because it lets you add code information that appears when you hover over the function. These comments take more time, but they're much less controversial due to their utility. Some of the most ardent fans even advocate for jsDoc over TypeScript. I don't know if I'd go that far, but the hover effect is super handy, and I love when codebases use them.
</p>

<my-code><!--
/**
 * To support a 3rd party integration we must
 * ping their servers and wait for OK signal
 * @param {object} user - user data sent after OK
 */
const createViaIntegration = (user) => {
--><pre></pre>
</my-code>

<h3>To don'ts</h3>
<p>
  Another common type of comment is <code>TODO: </code> and then some task. This is possibly the most controversial comment of all. Personally, I think they're great <em>before</em> you complete your PR. I always scan my PRs to make sure I got to everything I wanted to.
</p>
<p>
  However, if you find something too big to be done in the scope of your current work, I wouldn't recommend these comments. Instead, you should make tickets, which will ensure that it will get on the team's (and product manager's) radar. If it's a personal project it's not a big deal (most people don't use Jira for fun), but it's not a good sign when a codebase is littered with <code>TODO</code> comments. It usually means theres a breakdown in process somewhere.
</p>

<h2>Go out and comment responsibly</h2>
<p>
  Helping other people understand your code is a key part of being a great developer. Comments should be another tool in your belt, if used with discretion. I hope this helps, and if you have any comment conventions you like to use, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mostlyfocused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join the conversation on Reddit</a> to leave a <em>comment!</em>
</p>

<p>Happy coding everyone,</p>
<p>Mike</p>
